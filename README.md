# Robotic_Arm
Robotic Arm Project 

I built a 3-axis robotic arm in 8th standard using wood, four servo motors, potentiometers, and an Arduino Uno. Later, I upgraded it to record and playback positions automatically.

Now, I'm working on improving it further by implementing inverse kinematics. 
In the meantime, Iâ€™ve replaced the Arduino Uno with an ESP-32 to take advantage of its built-in Bluetooth, allowing me to control the arm using an Xbox game controller via the BluePad32 library.
